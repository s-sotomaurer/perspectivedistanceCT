# Perspective Distance Estimation for Camera Trap Photos
This is a tool written in Python for easily estimating distance to objects detected with camera traps.

## Installation and Setup
1. Install Python (>= 3.11.8)
    - The tool requires a Python installation (>= 3.11.8), which includes Tk. You can install python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


2. Virtual Environment
    - After installing python, you need to set up a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to install the required packages in a non-global path in your machine. To set up a virtual environment, open the command line in Linux:

          python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

    - or Windows:

          Python35\python -m venv c:\path\to\myenv


3. Pull Code from GitHub
     - Once you have set up a virtual environment, you can pull or download the code into the same path.

5. Dependencies
    - To install the necessary packages for using the software, run the following line inside the file path of your virtual environment:

          pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To use the programm, run `main.py` from the command line.

## Documentation
The software can be used and shared. This is a preliminary version and no tests are available. If you want to improve the code, feel free to request a pull.
